## Version History

### 0.7.x

**Version 0.7.5**

* First and last page navigation links courtesy of [@vcastello](https://github.com/scooper91).

**Version 0.7.4**

* The `precision` attribute has been removed from numeric columns, use Angular's [number](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter/number) filter instead.

**Version 0.7.3**

* I've added an `md-progress` [attribute](#table-progress) to the table element to trigger the progress indicator from outside the table scope.

* I'm also using `ng-value` instead of `value` in the pagination directive now, which should hopefully fix the issue some people are having with their trigger function being called on page load.

**Version 0.7.2**

* I've rewrapped the trigger functions in timeouts because I realize it's unexpected and inconvenient for the scope to be stale.

**Version 0.7.1**

* The function you pass to `md-trigger` will now be wrapped in a promise, meaning even if you call it from within your controller a loading indicator will be displayed. :)

* I've removed the `$timeout` when calling your `md-trigger` function meaning the function will be call **before** two-way data binding has had a chance to update your model scope.

* The reason your `md-trigger` function is being called when the page loads is because of a bug in the `mdSelect` module. I've created a pull request to fix this issue but as an immediate fix you can use a `String` instead of a `Number` for your `md-limit` value. For more information see the issue I opened awhile back [#3233](https://github.com/angular/material/issues/3233).

**Version 0.7.0**

* Conditionally disable row selection. See [Row Selection](#row-selection) for more details.

### 0.6.x

**Version 0.6.0**

* Register trigger handlers for column reorder and pagination change. If the function returns a promise, a loading indicator will be displayed.

### 0.5.x

**Version 0.5.1**

* You can now set the default sort direction for a column.

**Version 0.5.0**

* Support for `<tfoot>` elements.

### 0.4.x

**Version 0.4.7**

* Bug Fix: Numeric columns will now align properly when using `ngRepeat` to do client side sorting and pagination.
* Selected items will not be cleared when using `ngRepeat` to do client side sorting and pagination. (I don't know if they were before but I do know now).

**Version 0.4.6**

* Improvement: You can now interpolate the pagination label.
* Improvement: Pagination will now calculate an appropriate page based on the current min value when the number of rows are changed (hopefully).

**Version 0.4.5**

* Improvement: You must now explicitly place an `orderBy` attribute on a header cell to enable sorting on that column. This allows for a combination of columns that are sortable and not sortable.
* Improvement: you may now use `ngRepeat` on header cells with column ordering.

**Version 0.4.4**

* Bug Fix: When the number of rows per page is changed, pagination will now decrement the page until the min value is less than the total number of items or the page is zero.

**Version 0.4.3**

* Bug Fix: using `parseFloat` instead of `parseInt`. Thanks [@vcastello](https://github.com/vcastello)!

**Version 0.4.2**

* Bug Fix: Conditionally clearing selected items only when row selection is enabled. Good catch [@scooper91](https://github.com/scooper91)!

**Version 0.4.1**

* Bug Fix: two-way data binding of selected items.

**Version 0.4.0**

* A row will now reflect its selected status with a background fill
* New Feature: the `md-auto-select` attribute may be use to allow row selection by clicking anywhere inside the row.

### 0.3.x

**Version 0.3.1**

* accurate calculation of the width of column names
* improved styles for column padding and pagination

**Version 0.3.0**

* The working directory has been restructured at an attempt to be more organized.
* `md-filter` has been renamed to `md-order` for better naming convention.
* Column headers now display sort icons when column ordering is enabled.
* Bug Fix: Numeric columns will now right align without column ordering enabled.
